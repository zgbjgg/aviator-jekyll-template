#### _What is **Hurakann**?_

**Hurakann** is a computing distributed, decentralized, concurrent and lightweight software platform for building private or public applications in the cloud. **Hurakann** was built on the following premises:

* **Concurrent:** Support unlimited concurrent connections without side effects in performance.
* **Massive Data Processing:** Store unlimited amounts of information of objects and keep high performance.
* **Scalability:** Increase the capacity for process requests and storage adding nodes to a cluster as needed, adjusting automatically for higher performance.
* **Dynamical:** Store, fetch, update or delete information as needed, using API's or SDK's.
* **Availability:** Store, replicate and synchronize data between a collection of nodes, making it **"clusterizable"**
* **No-downtime:** Even updating any resource, always run in **"mode on"** in a transparent layer.

#### **_Motivation_**

Actually building an application (mobile, web, desktop) could be a tedious, large and slow task because developers need:

* A cloud server hardware to mount the back-end.
* To develop the back-end for data access.
* To design the database or how the data is structured.

Then, integration with the back-end side becomes a bottleneck in the development plan. **Hurakann** solves the problem providing a dynamic API to store, fetch, update and delete data that any application uses.


#### **_Managing users, objects and entities, "come on IoT (Internet of Things)!"_**

In real world almost every application require managing USERS, like register, manage profiles, login, relationships and the integration with the newly called IoT (Internet of Things), so each user, object or entity could be linked to devices, actions or specific features, or a USER can be considered an ENTITY, and ARTEFACT or a THING.

**Hurakann** is able to manage all actions related to a single USER so adding functionality, integrating other applications and adding iterations to such USER translates in lowering development time and cost savings.

All applications are built in a **"static"** way so when something requires to be integrated or something requires to be added, the task becomes really complicated and time consuming.

**Hurakann** provides a dynamic access to objects or actions so they may be changed in versatile ways. The platform is able to grow up on data volume and design on the fly without side effects in performance. At this point **Hurakann** becomes a dynamic database for any application using native code.


#### **_API - your database in the cloud simple and intelligible_**

**Hurakann** exposes the access to data stored in the database via RESTful services called API.

API is the collection of RESTful services that is designed for specific actions over your stored objects. The API uses single resources allocated in the private or public clouds using a standard data formatting like JSON or XML.

Any application looking for integration with **Hurakann** simply could access the platform through the API, using http protocol and following the correct structured file formats for each service.


#### **_SDK - jumping to implementation, don't worry about the black side_**

When an application is built with **Hurakann**, developers don't have to worry about how data is structured and accessed. However, in most cases, developers don't want to learn or become related to work with integration protocols, file formats, encode and decode data, and collect things that could become a **"headache"**.

At this point using **Hurakann** API could produce a backlog in development time and slow down integration, because developers don't know things such as: parse a file format, access to data parsed, send http requests, read responses, and other related things based on working with API's.

In response to that, **Hurakann** provides a native integration for managing objects and actions, using a native programming language that developers are able to use for integration.  Languages sucha as java, object C or javascript.

And that is something called **"SDK"** (Software Development Kit). The SDK is designed for each language to bind better with integration so **Hurakann** SDK is faster and easier to use than the **Hurakann** API.

_**Hurakann** SDK provides a native way for a language to consume an API and guarantee developers not to spend extra time in integration and testing._
